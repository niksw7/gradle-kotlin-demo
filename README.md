# gradle-kotlin-demo
This is a sample application written in Kotlin to package the application as fat jar.

<b>./gradlew build<br/>
java -jar build/libs/gradle-kotlin-demo-0.0.1.jar</b>

The intent of this project is to get a shippable jar out of kotlin source code.
And to avoid getting entangled in java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError errors.
